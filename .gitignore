# Frontend specific
# If you are using Vite, 'dist' is the default output directory
# If you were using Create React App, it would be 'build'
# Add any other frontend build output directories here if different
# e.g., if you had a 'public' folder for built assets:
# public/

# Backend specific
# If your backend generates any specific files you don't want to commit, add them here.
